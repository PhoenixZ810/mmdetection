The containers, two in pink and two in yellow, are arranged in a 2x2 grid. In the top left pink container, a slice of bread rests, lightly spread with butter and sprinkled with a handful of almonds. The bread is cut into a rectangle, and the almonds are scattered across its buttery surface. Adjacent to it in the top right corner, another pink container houses a mix of fruit. Sliced apples with their fresh white interiors exposed share the space with juicy chunks of pineapple. The colors of the apple slices and pineapple chunks contrast beautifully against the pink container. Below these, in the bottom left corner of the tray, a yellow container holds a single meatball alongside some broccoli. The meatball, round and browned, sits next to the vibrant green broccoli florets. Finally, in the bottom right yellow container, there's a sweet treat - a chocolate chip cookie. The golden-brown cookie is dotted with chocolate chips, their dark color standing out against the cookie's lighter surface."]}
